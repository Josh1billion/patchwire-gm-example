# Patchwire GameMaker: Studio example

This directory contains a GameMaker: Studio source file for an application that connects to a server to form a small chat room. For this game to run successfully, the server from the `server` directory must be running on the same machine.

The `.gmx` file in this directory is very self-documented. The best way to explore the code is to open it in GameMaker: Studio and read the (very, very small) source.
